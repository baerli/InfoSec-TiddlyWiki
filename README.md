# InfoSec-TiddlyWiki
InfoSec and Penetration Testing TiddlyWiki containing links to resources of various kinds.

## Description
Most of us working in InfoSec proably use some kind of information management system to collect all that juicy information we find online and stay up to date. To me, it is always so much that it is impossible to keep it together without tools and highly ineffective to start researching everytime I want to do know something about a particular field. I decided to somehow index the most relevant resources to get a quick overview over a topic whenever I need it.

## What am I using?
I am using a simple TiddlyWiki mainly to collect links to resources on the web. It does contain a note here and there, but it is in fact mainly links. They are structured using TiddlyWiki tags and try to represent typical InfoSec topics (e.g. Windows Domain Penetration Testing, Web Security, Exploit Development, Information Gathering and so on).

## How do I use it?
It's a simple HTML file containing everything you need. Open it using your favorite browser.
If some of you are interested in having it hosted, I could also upload it to some server serving the HTML file.

## Updates
Since I am collection stuff all the time whenevner some interesting resources come up, I will update the TiddlyWiki as well. 

## Publish yours as well
It would be awesome if people would go on and talk about their information management system as well or maybe release it since I guess it is interesting for a lot of people how we all are organized.
